abstract = {The Basilisk astrodynamics software architecture is being designed to be capable of both faster-than realtime simu-lations, including repeatable Monte-Carlo simulation options, as well as providing real-time options for hardware-in-the-loop simulations. The Basilisk package is designed as a set of Python modules written in C/C++ which allows for the ease of scripting and reconfigurability of Python while still providing the execution speed of C/C++. The software is being developed jointly by the University of Colorado Autonomous Vehicle Systems laboratory and the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics. The resulting framework is targeted for both astrodynamics research as well as sophisticated mission-specific vehicle simulations that include hardware-in-the-loop scenarios. This paper discusses how Basilisk is used to simulate attitude actuation devices such as reaction wheels (RWs) and attitude control system (ACS) thrusters. A modular framework allows for the these devices to be readily included in the dynamic simulation, and thus test candidate Attitude Determination and Control System (ADCS) control strategies. The RWs are modeled to include misalignment and mass imbalance properties. The thruster model simulates a minimum thruster impulse, thruster on and off ramping, as well as a finite thruster servo frequency. The paper discusses how the RW and ACSs components are simulated and analyzed for maneuvers such as a deep space sun-pointing attitudes with RWs, or a Mars orbit insertion with the ACS thrusters.},

abstract = {Reinforcement learning offers to robotics a framework and set of tools for the design of sophisticated and hard-to-engineer behaviors. Conversely, the challenges of robotic problems provide both inspiration, impact, and validation for developments in reinforcement learning. The relationship between disciplines has sufficient promise to be likened to that between physics and mathematics. In this article, we attempt to strengthen the links between the two research communities by providing a survey of work in reinforcement learning for behavior generation in robots. We highlight both key challenges in robot reinforcement learning as well as notable successes. We discuss how contributions tamed the complexity of the domain and study the role of algorithms, representations, and prior knowledge in achieving these successes. As a result, a particular focus of our paper lies on the choice between model-based and model-free as well as between value-function-based and policy-search methods. By analyzing a simple problem in some detail we demonstrate how reinforcement learning approaches may be profitably applied, and we note throughout open questions and the tremendous potential for future research.},

This can cause problems for traditional reinforcement learning algorithms which assume discrete states and actions. In this paper, we introduce an algorithm that safely approximates the value function for continuous state control tasks, and that learns quickly from a small amount of data. We give experimental results using this algorithm to learn policies for both a simulated task and also for a real robot, operating in an unaltered environment. The algorithm works well in a traditional learning setting, and demonstrates extremely good learning when bootstrapped with a small amount of human-provided data.},

NASA reached out to the National Research Council (NRC) to review the program objectives and prioritize the list of technologies. In January 2012, the NRC released its report entitled “Restoring NASA's Technological Edge and Paving the Way for a New Era in Space.” While the NRC report provides a systematic and thorough ranking of the future technology needs for NASA, it does not discuss in detail the technical aspects of its prioritized technologies (which lie beyond its scope). This chapter, building upon this framework, aims at providing such technical details for a selected number of high-priority technologies in the autonomous systems area. Specifically, this chapter focuses on technology area TA04 “Robotics, Tele-Robotics, and Autonomous Systems” and discusses in some detail the technical aspects and challenges associated with three high-priority TA04 technologies: “Relative Guidance Algorithms,” “Extreme Terrain Mobility,” and “Small Body/Microgravity Mobility.” Each of these technologies is discussed along four main dimensions: scope, need, state-of-the-art, and challenges/future directions. The result is a unified presentation of key autonomy challenges for next-generation space missions.},

This Continuous U Tree algorithm trans- fers traditional regression tree techniques to reinforcement learning. We have performed experiments in a variety of do- mains that show that Continuous U Tree effectively handles large continuous state spaces.

abstract = {With the launch of Deep Space 1 in 1998, the autonomous systems community celebrated a milestone—the first flight experiment demonstrating the feasibility of a fully autonomous spacecraft. We anticipated that the advanced autonomy demonstrated on Deep Space 1 would soon be pervasive, enabling science missions, making spacecraft more resilient, and reducing operational costs. However, the pace of adoption has been relatively slow. When autonomous systems have been used, either operationally or as an experiment or demonstration, they have been successful. In addition, outstanding work by the autonomous-systems community has continued to advance the technologies of autonomous systems (Casta{\~{n}}o et al., 2006; Chien et al., 2005; Estlin et al., 2008; Fong et al., 2008; Knight, 2008). There are many reasons for putting autonomous systems on board spacecraft. These include maintenance of the spacecraft despite failures or damage, extension of the science team through “virtual presence,” and cost-effective operation over long periods of time. Why, then, has the goal of autonomy not been more broadly adopted?},

abstract = {Distributed Space Missions (DSMs) are gaining momentum in their application to earth science missions owing to their unique ability to increase observation sampling in angular, spatial, spectral and temporal dimensions simultaneously. DSM architectures have a large number of design variables and since they are expected to increase mission flexibility, scalability, evolvability and robustness, their design is a complex problem with many variables and objectives affecting performance. There are few open-access tools available to explore the tradespace of variables which allow performance assessment and are easy to plug into science goals, and therefore select the most optimal design. This paper presents a software framework developed on the MATLAB engine interfacing with STK, for DSM orbit design and selection. The associated tool is capable of generating thousands of homogeneous constellation or formation flight architectures based on pre-defined design variable ranges and sizing those architectures in terms of pre-defined performance metrics. The metrics can be input into observing system simulation experiments, as available from the science teams, allowing dynamic coupling of science and engineering designs. Design variables include constellation type, formation flight type, instrument view, altitude and inclination of chief orbits, differential orbital elements, leader satellites, latitudes or regions of interest, planes and satellite numbers. Intermediate performance metrics include angular coverage, number of accesses, revisit coverage, access deterioration over time at every point of the Earth's grid. The orbit design process can be streamlined and variables more bounded along the way, owing to the availability of low fidelity and low complexity models such as corrected HCW equations up to high precision STK models with J2 and drag. The tool can thus help any scientist or program manager select pre-Phase A, Pareto optimal DSM designs for a variety of science goals without having to delve into the details of the engineering design process. This paper uses cases measurements for multi-angular earth observation to demonstrate the applicability of the tool.},

abstract = {Aerobraking has previously been used to reduce the propellant required to deliver an orbiter to its desired final orbit. In principle, aerobraking should be possible around any target planet or moon having sufficient atmosphere to permit atmospheric drag to provide a portion of the mission AV, in lieu of supplying all of the required AV propulsively. The spacecraft is flown through the upper atmosphere of the target using multiple passes, ensuring that the dynamic pressure and thermal loads remain within the spacecraft's design parameters. NASA has successfully conducted aerobraking operations four times, once at Venus and three times at Mars. While aerobraking reduces the fuel required, it does so at the expense of time (typically 3-6 months), continuous Deep Space Network (DSN) coverage, and a large ground staff. These factors can result in aerobraking being a very expensive operational phase of the mission. However, aerobraking has matured to the point that much of the daily operation could potentially be performed autonomously onboard the spacecraft, thereby reducing the required ground support and attendant aerobraking related costs. To facilitate a lower-risk transition from ground processing to an autonomous capability, the NASA Engineering and Safety Center (NESC) has assembled a team of experts in aerobraking and interplanetary guidance and control to develop a high-fidelity, flight-like simulation. This simulation will be used to demonstrate the overall feasibility while exploring the potential for staff and DSN coverage reductions that autonomous aerobraking might provide. This paper reviews the various elements of autonomous aerobraking and presents an overview of the various models and algorithms that must be transformed from the current ground processing methodology to a flight-like environment. Additionally the high-fidelity flight software test bed, being developed from models used in a recent interplanetary mission, will be summarized. {\textcopyright} 2013 IAA.},

The control forces required for rendezvous maneuvers at low Earth orbits can be generated by varying the aerodynamic drag affecting each spacecraft. This can be accomplished, for example, by rotating dedicated sets of drag panels. Thus, the relative spacecraft motion can be controlled without using any propellant since the motion of the panels can be powered by solar energy. A novel adaptive Lyapunov controller is designed, and a critical value for the relative drag acceleration that ensures Lyapunov stability is found. The critical value is used to adapt the Lyapunov controller, enhancing its performance. The method is validated using simulations. The results show that the Adaptive Lyapunov technique outperforms previous control strategies for differential drag based spacecraft maneuvering. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {This paper presents the design and implementation of a model predictive control (MPC) system to guide and control a chasing spacecraft during rendezvous with a passive target spacecraft in an elliptical or circular orbit, from the point of target detection all the way to capture. To achieve an efficient system design, the rendezvous manoeuvre has been partitioned into three main phases based on the range of operation, plus a collision-avoidance manoeuvre to be used in event of a fault. Each has its own associated MPC controller. Linear time-varying models are used to enable trajectory predictions in elliptical orbits, whilst a variable prediction horizon is used to achieve finite-time completion of manoeuvres, and a 1-norm cost on velocity change minimises propellant consumption. Constraints are imposed to ensure that trajectories do not collide with the target. A key feature of the design is the implementation of non-convex constraints as switched convex constraints, enabling the use of convex linear and quadratic programming. The system is implemented using commercial-off-the-shelf tools with deployment using automatic code generation in mind, and validated by closed-loop simulation. A significant reduction in total propellant consumption in comparison with a baseline benchmark solution is observed. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

An optimal control approach to the problem of orbital rendez-vous using differential drag is proposed in this paper. Thanks to the scheduling of a reference maneuver by means of a direct transcription, the method is flexible in terms of cost function and can easily account for constraints of various nature. Considerations on the practical realization of differential-drag-based maneuvers are also provided.

abstract = {At low Earth orbits, differentials in the drag forces between spacecraft can be used for controlling their relative motion in the orbital plane. Current methods for determining the drag force may result in errors due to inaccuracies in the density models and drag coefficients. In this work, a methodology for relative maneuvering of spacecraft based on differential drag, accounting for uncertainties in the drag model, is proposed. A dynamical model composed of the mean semimajor axis and the argument of latitude is used for describing long-range maneuvers. For this model, a linear quadratic regulator is implemented, accounting for the uncertainties in the drag force. The actuation is the pitch angle of the satellites, considering saturation. The control scheme guarantees asymptotic stability of the system up to a certain magnitude of the state vector, which is determined by the uncertainties. Numerical simulations show that the method exhibits consistent robustness to accomplish the maneuvers, even in the presence of realistic modeling of density fields, drag coefficients, the corotation of the atmosphere, and zonal harmonics up to J 8 . Nomenclature A i = cross-sectional area of the surface i of the spacecraft, m 2 a D = drag force per unit mass, km∕s 2 a = mean semimajor axis, km C B = spacecraft's ballistic coefficient, m 2 ∕kg C D i = drag coefficient of the surface i of the spacecraft i = mean inclination, rad m = spacecraft's mass, kg P = positive-definite matrix, solution of the algebraic Riccati equation r = spacecraft's inertial position, km S i = surface of the face i of the spacecraft, m 2 v = spacecraft's inertial velocity, km∕s v atm = Earth atmosphere's inertial velocity, km∕s v rel = velocity vector of the spacecraft relative to the atmosphere, km∕s $\beta$ = attitude angle, deg $\eta$ = uncertainties (modeling errors) in the input, 1∕km $\theta$ = argument of latitude, rad $\mu$ = Earth's gravitational parameter, km 3 ∕s 2 $\nu$ = control input to the system, 1∕km $\rho$ = Earth's atmospheric density, kg∕m 3},

abstract = {Aerobraking is a proven method of significantly increasing fire science payload that can be placed into low Mars orbits when compared to an all propulsive capture. However the aerobraking phase is long and has mission cost and risk implications. The main cost benefit is that aerobraking permits the use of a smaller and cheaper launch vehicle, but additional operational costs are incurred during the long aerobraking phase. Risk is increased due to the repeated thermal loading of spacecraft components and the multiple attitude kind propulsive maneuvers required for successful aerobraking. Both the cost and risk burdens can be significantly reduced by automating the aerobraking operations phase. All of the previous Mars orbiter missions that have used aerobraking have increasingly relied on onboard calculations during aerobraking. Even though the tempearature of spacecraft components has been the limiting factor, operational methods have relied on using a surrogate variable for mission control. This paper describes several methods, based directly on space craft component maximum temperature, tor autonomously predicting the subsequent aerobraking, orbits and prescribing apoapsis propulsive maneuvers to maintain the spacecraft within specified temperature limits. Specifically, this paper describes the rise of thermal response surface analysis in predicting the temperature of the spacecraft components and the corresponding uncertainty in this temperature prediction.},

abstract = {The paper discusses the coupled attitude-orbit dynamics and control of an electric-sail-based spacecraft in a heliocentric transfer mission. The mathematical model characterizing the propulsive thrust is first described as a function of the orbital radius and the sail angle. Since the solar wind dynamic pressure acceleration is induced by the sail attitude, the orbital and attitude dynamics of electric sails are coupled, and are discussed together. Based on the coupled equations, the flight control is investigated, wherein the orbital control is studied in an optimal framework via a hybrid optimization method and the attitude controller is designed based on feedback linearization control. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy, a transfer problem from Earth to Mars is considered. The numerical results show that the proposed strategy can control the coupled system very well, and a small control torque can control both the attitude and orbit. The study in this paper will contribute to the theory study and application of electric sail.},

@article{Spencer2007,
abstract = {Four missions have successfully employed aerobraking at Venus and Mars to reduce the spacecraft orbit period and achieve the desired orbit geometry. The propellant mass reductions enabled by the aerobraking technique allow the use of smaller launch systems, which translate to significant savings in launch costs for flight projects. However, there is a significant increase in mission risk associated with the use of aerobraking. Flying a spacecraft through a planetary atmosphere hundreds of times during months of around-the-clock operations places the spacecraft in harm's way, and is extraordinarily demanding on the flight team. There is a cost/risk trade that must be evaluated when a project is choosing between a mission baseline that includes aerobraking, or selecting a larger launch vehicle to enable purely propulsive orbit insertion. This paper provides a brief history of past and future aerobraking missions, describes the aerobraking technique, summarizes the costs associated with aerobraking, and concludes with a suggested methodology for evaluating the cost/risk trade when considering the aerobraking approach.},

abstract = {This paper presents a new method, based on a multiple-model adaptive estimation approach, to determine the most probable shape of a spacecraft in orbit among a number of candidate shape models while simultaneously recovering the observed resident space object's inertial orientation and trajectory. Multiple-model adaptive estimation uses a parallel bank of filters to provide multiple resident space object state estimates, where each filter is purposefully dependent on a mutually unique resident space object model. Estimates on the conditional probability of each model given the available measurements are provided from the multiple-model adaptive estimation approach. Each filter employs the Unscented (or Sigma-Point) estimation approach, reducing passively-collected electro-optical data to infer the unknown state vector comprised of the resident space object inertial-to-body orientation, position and their respective temporal rates. Each hypothesized model results in a different observed optical cross-sectional area. The effect of solar radiation pressure may be recovered from accurate angles-data alone, if the collected measurements span a sufficiently long period of time so as to make the non-conservative mismodeling effects noticeable. However, for relatively short data arcs, this effect is weak and thus the temporal brightness of the resident space object can be used in concert with the angles data to exploit the fused sensitivity to both resident space object characteristics and associated trajectory, the very same ones which drive the non-conservative dynamic effects. Recovering these characteristics and trajectories with sufficient accuracy is shown in this paper, where the characteristics are inherent in unique resident space object models. The performance of this strategy is demonstrated via simulated scenarios. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2010 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc. All rights reserved.},

The paper deals with the use of air drag to control the relative position of two satellites belonging to a formation. The focus is on evaluating optimal strategies which take into account and minimize the orbital decay. An approach which makes use of a recent formulation of the Euler Hill equations modified to include the drag is proposed. A semi analytical solution is provided as input to an optimizer based on genetic algorithms. Advantages of this choice are explained, together with indications on the simulations performed.},

Their discussion ranges from the history of the field's intellectual foundations to the most recent developments and applications. The only necessary mathematical background is familiarity with elementary concepts of probability. The book is divided into three parts. Part I defines the reinforcement learning problem in terms of Markov decision processes. Part II provides basic solution methods: dynamic programming, Monte Carlo methods, and temporal-difference learning. Part III presents a unified view of the solution methods and incorporates artificial neural networks, eligibility traces, and planning; the two final chapters present case studies and consider the future of reinforcement learning.},

abstract = {After a seven-month interplanetary cruise, the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter arrived at Mars and executed a 1.0 km/s Mars Orbit Insertion (MOI) maneuver. The post-MOI orbit was highly elliptical with a 35 hour, 428km x 45000km altitude orbit. To establish a useful science orbit, the navigation team used an aerobraking technique to guide the spacecraft into a 2-hour, 255km x 320 km altitude orbit. This paper details the aerobraking navigation operation strategy and flight results. It also describes the aerobraking key requirements and navigation challenges. {\textcopyright} 2008 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc. All rights reserved.},

@article{Ben-Yaacov2013,
abstract = {The idea to use differential drag for satellite formation keeping emerged in the mid-1980s, when the feasibility of differential-drag-based control was proven, assuming linearized relative dynamics for two satellites. Unlike previous work in differential-drag-based formation keeping, the present work develops a nonlinear method suitable for missions in excess of a year. It is shown that the differential mean eccentricity is uncontrollable for near-circular orbits, and hence a nonlinear differential-drag-based controller for matching the drag-related secular component of the semimajor axis is developed. An asymptotic stability proof for the controller is provided. Moreover, two new methods for differential-drag-based cluster keeping of multiple modules are developed, thus expanding existing literature, which usually deals with two satellites only. The results are validated using simulations based on the forthcoming Space Autonomous Mission for Swarming and Geolocation with Nanosatellites, showing that diff...},

@article{Bevilacqua2009,
abstract = {Anovel two-phase hybrid controller isproposed to optimizepropellantconsump- tion during multiple spacecraft rendezvous maneuvers in Low Earth Orbit. This controller exploits generated differentials in aerodynamic drag on each involved chaser spacecraft to effect a propellant-free trajectory near to the target spacecraft during the first phase of the maneuver, and then uses a fuel optimal control strategy via continuous low-thrust engines to effect a precision dock during the second phase. In particular, by varying the imparted aero- dynamic drag force on each of the chaser spacecraft, relative differential accelerations are generated between each chaser and the target spacecraft along two of the three translational degrees of freedom. In order to generate this required differential, each chaser spacecraft is assumed to include a system of rotating flat panels. Additionally, each chaser spacecraft is assumed to have continuous low-thrust capability along the three translational degrees of freedom and full-axis attitude control. Sample simulations are presented to support the validity and robustness of the proposed hybrid controller to variations in the atmospheric density along with different spacecraft masses and ballistic coefficients. Furthermore, the proposed hybrid controller is validated against a complete nonlinear orbitalmodel to include relative navigation errors typical of carrier-phase differential GPS (CDGPS). Limitations of the proposed controller appear relative to the target spacecraft's orbit eccentricity and a general characterization of the atmospheric density. Bounds on these variables are included to provide a framework within which the proposed hybrid controller can effect an extremely low propellant rendezvous of multiple chaser spacecraft to a desired target spacecraft.},

abstract = {An object recognition system has been developed that uses a new class of local image features. The features are invariant to image scaling, translation, and rotation, and partially invariant to illumination changes and affine or 3D projection. These features share similar properties with neurons in inferior temporal cortex that are used for object recognition in primate vision. Features are efficiently detected through a staged filtering approach that identifies stable points in scale space. Image keys are created that allow for local geometric deformations by representing blurred image gradients in multiple orientation planes and at multiple scales. The keys are used as input to a nearest neighbor indexing method that identifies candidate object matches. Final verification of each match is achieved by finding a low residual least squares solution for the unknown model parameters. Experimental results show that robust object recognition can be achieved in cluttered partially occluded images with a computation time of under 2 seconds},
