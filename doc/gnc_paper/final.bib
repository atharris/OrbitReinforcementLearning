abstract = {After a seven-month interplanetary cruise, the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter arrived at Mars and executed a 1.0 km/s Mars Orbit Insertion (MOI) maneuver. The post-MOI orbit was highly elliptical with a 35 hour, 428km x 45000km altitude orbit. To establish a useful science orbit, the navigation team used an aerobraking technique to guide the spacecraft into a 2-hour, 255km x 320 km altitude orbit. This paper details the aerobraking navigation operation strategy and flight results. It also describes the aerobraking key requirements and navigation challenges. {\textcopyright} 2008 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Reinforcement learning, one of the most active research areas in artificial intelligence, is a computational approach to learning whereby an agent tries to maximize the total amount of reward it receives when interacting with a complex, uncertain environment. In Reinforcement Learning, Richard Sutton and Andrew Barto provide a clear and simple account of the key ideas and algorithms of reinforcement learning. Their discussion ranges from the history of the field's intellectual foundations to the most recent developments and applications. The only necessary mathematical background is familiarity with elementary concepts of probability. The book is divided into three parts. Part I defines the reinforcement learning problem in terms of Markov decision processes. Part II provides basic solution methods: dynamic programming, Monte Carlo methods, and temporal-difference learning. Part III presents a unified view of the solution methods and incorporates artificial neural networks, eligibility traces, and planning; the two final chapters present case studies and consider the future of reinforcement learning.},
